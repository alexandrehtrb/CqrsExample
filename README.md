# CQRS Example

[Ler em portuguÃªs](README_pt.md)

This project is an example of a shopping list API, to show some software architectural concepts, mainly CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation).

The API is an ASP NET WebAPI using .NET 7, with as few external dependencies as possible.

## To run the project

The project requires only [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) installed. The API uses an in-memory database, so no database is necessary. The API testing requires [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

The `runserverlocal.ps1` script builds and runs the API, listening on `http://localhost:5000`.

The `rununittests.ps1` script runs the unit tests and generates a testing coverage report at a `TestResults` folder. It requires the [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) installed.

To run the API tests, import the Postman collection and environment files located at the `tests` folder, then start the collection runner (tutorial [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/)).
